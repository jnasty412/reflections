What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?
	I think it creates an empty memory in space, much like creating a new object in OOP languages but not assigning anything to it.

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?
	The staging area takes files chosen from the working directory and puts them on a "ready list" to go into the repository. I think it's kind of like quality control in case you go to put the wrong file in it's not in there yet.
